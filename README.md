# Data transformation with style-transformer
Based on style-transformer, we implement style-bart to incorporate bart model in transforming feedback conversation data into human bot conversation data.

The bart model is pre-trained with chatbot training data, so it can produce the response from the given context.

# Notebooks 
Notebooks are used to get several baseline scores of regex and polyencoder

# Processed data
New chatbot training data samples transformed by style-bart from feedback data.
